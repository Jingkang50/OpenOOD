# OpenOOD leaderboard

**Leaderboard website**: https://zjysteven.github.io/OpenOOD/

**Paper:** [OpenOOD v1.5: Enhanced Benchmark for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09301)


## Main idea
  
`OpenOOD` aims to provide accurate, standardized, and unified evaluation of OOD detection.
There are at least 100+ works on OOD detection in the past 6 years, but it is still unclear which approaches really work since the evaluation setup is highly inconsistent from paper to paper.
OpenOOD currently provides 6 benchmarks for OOD detection (4 for standard setting and 2 for full-spectrum setting) in the context of image classification and benchmarks 40 advanced methodologies within our framework.
We expect OpenOOD to foster collective efforts in the community towards advancing the state-of-the-art in OOD detection.



## Contributions
Contributions both to the leaderboard and our [codebase](https://github.com/Jingkang50/OpenOOD/) are very welcome, as well as any suggestions for improving the project! We would be happy to hear any feedback on how to make it better and more comprehensive.
